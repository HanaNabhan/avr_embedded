# AVR workspace

This repository hosts a collection of AVR drivers and embedded systems projects designed using AVR microcontrollers.

## Overview

The repository includes drivers for various peripherals. Each driver is designed to be modular and easily integrated into different projects. Alongside these drivers, youâ€™ll find complete project examples that demonstrate the application of these drivers in real-world scenarios.


### Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following:

- An AVR development environment ( AVR-GCC, Atmel Studio or any other compatible IDE).
- Basic knowledge of C programming and embedded systems.
- A compatible AVR microcontroller and development board.


## Usage

Each driver comes with a header and source files. 

1. **Drivers**: Integrate these drivers into your project by including the corresponding header and source files.
2. **Projects**: Compile and upload the project code to your AVR microcontroller to see the drivers in action.
